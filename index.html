    <p> The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is an American media franchise and shared fictional universe that is centered on
        a series of superhero films, independently produced by Marvel Studios and based on characters that appear in publications
        by Marvel Comics. The franchise has expanded to include comic books, short films, and television series. The shared
        universe, much like the original Marvel Universe in comic books, was established by crossing over common plot elements,
        settings, cast, and characters. Clark Gregg has appeared the most in the franchise, portraying Phil Coulson, a character
        original to the MCU. The first film released in the MCU was Iron Man (2008), which began the first phase of films,
        culminating in the Marvel's The Avengers (2012) crossover film. "Phase Two" began with Iron Man 3 (2013), and concluded
        with Ant-Man (2015). Marvel is also preparing "Phase Three", beginning with the release of Captain America: Civil
        War (2016). Marvel Television expanded the universe further, first to network television with Marvel's Agents of
        S.H.I.E.L.D. on ABC in the 2013â€“14 television season, and then to online streaming with Marvel's Daredevil on Netflix
        in 2015. The MCU also includes tie-in comics and the Marvel One-Shots direct-to-video short films. The franchise
        has been seen as an impressive and groundbreaking success in terms of a multimedia shared universe, though critics
        have found that some of its films and television series have suffered in service of the wider universe. It has inspired
        other film and television studios with comic book character adaptation rights to attempt to create similar shared
        universes.
