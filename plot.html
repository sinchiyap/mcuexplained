                    from his father, is in war-torn Afghanistan with his friend and military liaison, Lieutenant Colonel
                    James Rhodes to demonstrate the new "Jericho" missile.

                    <br> The convoy is ambushed and Stark is critically wounded by one of his own rocket propelled grenades.
                    He is captured and imprisoned in a cave by the terrorist group the Ten Rings, and an electromagnet is
                    grafted into his chest by fellow captive Yinsen to keep the shrapnel shell shards that wounded him from
                    reaching his heart and killing him. Ten Rings leader Raza offers Stark freedom in exchange for building
                    a Jericho missile for the group, but Tony and Yinsen agree Raza will not keep his word. Stark and Yinsen
                    secretly build a powerful electric generator called an arc reactor to power Stark's electromagnet and
                    a suit of powered armor to aid in their escape. Although they keep the suit hidden almost to completion,
                    the Ten Rings attack the workshop when they discover their intentions. Yinsen sacrifices himself to divert
                    them while the suit powers up. The armored Stark battles his way out of the cave to find the dying Yinsen,
                    then in anger burns the Ten Rings weapons and flies away, crashing in the desert and destroying the suit.

                    <br> After being rescued by Rhodes, Stark returns home and announces that his company will no longer manufacture
                    weapons. Obadiah Stane, his father's old partner and the company's manager, advises Stark that this may
                    ruin Stark Industries and his father's legacy. In his home workshop, Stark builds an improved version
                    of his suit, as well as a more powerful arc reactor for his chest.

                    <br> Personal assistant Pepper Potts places the original reactor inside a small glass showcase. Though Stane
                    requests details, Stark keeps his work to himself. At a charity event held by Stark Industries, reporter
                    Christine Everhart informs Stark that his company's weapons, including the Jericho, were recently delivered
                    to the Ten Rings and are being used to attack Yinsen's home village, Gulmira. Stark also learns Stane
                    is trying to replace him as head of the company. Enraged by these revelations, Stark dons his new armor
                    and flies to Afghanistan, where he saves Yinsen's village. While flying home, Stark is shot at by two
                    F-22 Raptor fighter jets. He reveals his secret identity to Rhodes over the phone in an attempt to end
                    the attack.

                    <br> Meanwhile, the Ten Rings gather the pieces of Stark's prototype suit and meet with Stane, who subdues
                    Raza with a sonic device and has the rest of the group killed. Stane has a new suit reverse engineered
                    from the wreckage. Seeking to find any other weapons delivered to the Ten Rings, Stark sends Pepper to
                    hack into the company computer system from Stane's office. She discovers Stane has been supplying the
                    terrorists and hired the Ten Rings to kill Stark, but the group reneged. Potts meets with Agent Phil
                    Coulson of S.H.I.E.L.D., a counter-terrorism agency, to inform him of Stane's activities. Stane's scientists
                    cannot duplicate Stark's arc reactor so Stane ambushes Stark at home and takes his, though Stark manages
                    to get to his original reactor to replace the taken one. Potts and several S.H.I.E.L.D. agents attempt
                    to arrest Stane, but he dons his suit and attacks them. Stark fights Stane, but is outmatched without
                    his new reactor to run his suit at full capacity.

                    <br> Stark lures Stane atop the Stark Industries building and instructs Potts to overload the large arc reactor
                    there. This unleashes a massive electrical surge that causes Stane and his armor to fall into the exploding
                    reactor, killing him. The next day, at a press conference, Stark admits to being the superhero the press
                    has dubbed "Iron Man". In a post-credits scene, S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury visits Stark at home,
                    telling him that Iron Man is not "the only superhero in the world", and explaining that he wants to discuss
                    the "Avengers Initiative".

                <strong>The Incredible Hulk</strong>
                <p id="tih">
                    <fl>A</fl>t Culver University in Virginia, General Thunderbolt Ross meets with Dr. Bruce Banner, the colleague
                    and boyfriend of his daughter Betty, regarding an experiment that Ross claims is meant to make humans
                    immune to gamma radiation. The experiment — part of a World War II era "super soldier" program that Ross
                    hopes to recreate — fails, and the exposure to gamma radiation causes Banner to transform into the Hulk
                    for brief periods of time, whenever his heart rate rises above 200. The Hulk destroys the lab and injures
                    or kills the people inside. Banner becomes a fugitive from the U.S. military and Ross in particular,
                    who wants to weaponize the Hulk process.

                    <img src="images/02hulk/hulk_university.jpg" alt="Bruce Banner transforming into Hulk" width="470" height="268">
                    <br> Five years later, Banner works at a bottling factory in Rocinha, Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, while searching
                    for a cure for his condition. On the Internet, he collaborates with a colleague he knows only as "Mr.
                    Blue", and to whom he is "Mr. Green". He is also learning meditative breathing techniques to help keep
                    control, and has not transformed in five months. After Banner cuts his finger, a drop of his blood falls
                    into a bottle, and is eventually ingested by an elderly consumer in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, giving him
                    gamma sickness.
                    <br>
                    <img src="images/02hulk/hulkstanlee.jpg" alt="Gamma Sickness" width="960" height="408">
                    <br> Using the bottle to track down Banner, Ross sends a SWAT team, led by Russian-born British Royal Marine
                    Emil Blonsky, to capture him. Banner transforms into the Hulk and defeats Blonsky's team. After Ross
                    explains how Banner became the Hulk, Blonsky agrees to be injected with a small amount of a similar serum,
                    which gives him enhanced speed, strength, agility, and healing, but also begins to deform his skeleton
                    and impair his judgment. Banner returns to Culver University and reunites with Betty, who is dating psychiatrist
                    Leonard Samson. Banner is attacked by Ross and Blonsky's forces, tipped off by the suspicious Samson,
                    causing him to again transform into the Hulk. The ensuing battle outside the university proves to be
                    futile for Ross' forces and they eventually retreat, though Blonsky, whose sanity is starting to falter,
                    boldly attacks and mocks the Hulk. The Hulk seemingly kills Blonsky and flees with Betty.

                    <br> After the Hulk reverts to Banner, he and Betty go on the run, and Banner contacts Mr. Blue, who urges
                    them to meet him in New York City. Mr. Blue is actually cellular biologist Dr. Samuel Sterns, who tells
                    Banner he has developed a possible antidote to Banner's condition. After a successful test, he warns
                    Banner that the antidote may only reverse each individual transformation. Sterns reveals he has synthesized
                    Banner's blood samples, which Banner sent from Brazil, into a large supply, with the intention of applying
                    its "limitless potential" to medicine. Fearful of the Hulk's power falling into the military's hands,
                    Banner wishes to destroy the blood supply. Meanwhile, Blonsky is revealed to have survived the battle
                    and has completely healed. He joins Ross' forces for a third attempt to take Banner into custody. They
                    succeed and Banner, along with Betty, are taken away in a helicopter. Blonsky stays behind and forces
                    Sterns to inject him with Banner's blood, as he covets the Hulk's power. Sterns warns that the combination
                    of the super-soldier formula and Banner's blood may cause him to become an "abomination", but Blonsky
                    insists. The experiment mutates Blonsky into a creature with size and strength surpassing that of the
                    Hulk, but drives him mad.

                    <br> He attacks Sterns, who gets some of Banner's blood in a cut on his forehead, causing him to begin mutating
                    as well. Blonsky then rampages through Harlem. Realizing that the Hulk is the only one who can stop Blonsky,
                    Banner convinces Ross to release him. He jumps from Ross' helicopter and transforms after hitting the
                    ground. After a long and brutal battle through Harlem, the Hulk defeats Blonsky. After having a small,
                    peaceful moment with Betty, the Hulk flees from New York. A month later, Banner is in Bella Coola, British
                    Columbia. Instead of trying to suppress his transformation, he successfully transforms in a controlled
                    manner. In a final scene, Tony Stark approaches Ross at a local bar and informs him a team is being put
                    together.

                    <fl>I</fl>n Russia, the media covers Tony Stark's disclosure of his identity as Iron Man. Ivan Vanko, whose
                    father Anton Vanko has just died, sees this and begins building a miniature arc reactor similar to Stark's.
                    Six months later, Stark is a superstar and uses his Iron Man suit for peaceful means, resisting government
                    pressure to sell his designs. He re-institutes the Stark Expo in Flushing Meadows to continue his father
                    Howard's legacy. The palladium core in the arc reactor that keeps Stark alive and powers the armor is
                    slowly poisoning him, and he cannot find a substitute.

                    <br> Growing increasingly despondent and reckless due to his impending death, and choosing not to tell anyone
                    about his condition, Stark appoints his personal assistant Pepper Potts CEO of Stark Industries, and
                    hires Stark employee Natalie Rushman as his personal assistant. Stark competes in the Monaco Historic
                    Grand Prix, where he is attacked in the middle of the race by Vanko who wields electrified whips. Stark
                    dons his Mark V armor and defeats Vanko, but the suit is severely damaged. Vanko explains his intention
                    was to prove to the world that Iron Man is not invincible. Impressed by Vanko's performance, Stark's
                    rival, Justin Hammer, fakes Vanko's death while breaking him out of prison and asks him to build a line
                    of armored suits to upstage Stark.

                    <br>During what he believes is his final birthday party, Stark gets drunk while wearing the Mark IV suit.
                    Disgusted, U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes dons Stark's Mark II prototype armor and tries
                    to restrain him. The fight ends in a stalemate, so Rhodes confiscates the Mark II for the US Air Force.
                    Nick Fury, director of S.H.I.E.L.D., approaches Stark, revealing "Rushman" to be undercover agent Natasha
                    Romanoff and that Howard Stark was a S.H.I.E.L.D. founder whom Fury knew personally. Fury explains that
                    Vanko's father jointly invented the arc reactor with Stark, but when Anton tried to sell it for profit,
                    Stark had him deported. The Soviets sent Anton to the gulag.

                    Expo proves to be a diagram of the structure of a new element. With the aid of his computer J.A.R.V.I.S.,
                    Stark synthesizes it. When he learns Vanko is still alive, he places the new element in his arc reactor
                    and ends his palladium dependency. At the Expo, Hammer unveils Vanko's armored drones, led by Rhodes
                    in a heavily weaponized version of the Mark II armor. Stark arrives in the Mark VI armor to warn Rhodes,
                    but Vanko remotely takes control of both the drones and Rhodes' armor and attacks Iron Man.

                    Vanko escapes, but Romanoff returns control of the Mark II armor to Rhodes. Stark and Rhodes together
                    defeat Vanko and his drones. Vanko seemingly commits suicide by blowing up his suit. At a debriefing,
                    while news footage of a rampaging Hulk plays, Fury informs Stark that because of his difficult personality,
                    S.H.I.E.L.D. intends to use him only as a consultant. Stark and Rhodes receive medals for their heroism.
                    In a post-credits scene, S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Phil Coulson reports the discovery of a large hammer at the

                    by his hammer Mjolnir, now protected by an enchantment that allows only the worthy to wield it. Thor
                    lands in New Mexico, where astrophysicist Dr. Jane Foster, her assistant Darcy Lewis, and mentor Dr.
                    Erik Selvig, find him. The local populace finds Mjolnir, which S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Phil Coulson soon commandeers
                    before forcibly acquiring Jane's data about the wormhole that delivered Thor to Earth. Thor, having discovered
                    Mjolnir's nearby location, seeks to retrieve it from the facility that S.H.I.E.L.D. quickly constructed
                    but he finds himself unable to lift it, and is captured.

                    Jane. Loki discovers that he is actually Laufey's son, adopted by Odin after the war ended. A weary Odin
                    falls into the deep "Odinsleep" to recover his strength. Loki seizes the throne in Odin's stead and offers
                    Laufey the chance to kill Odin and retrieve the Casket. Sif and the Warriors Three, unhappy with Loki's
                    rule, attempt to return Thor from exile, convincing Heimdall, gatekeeper of the Bifröst—the means of
                    traveling between worlds—to allow them passage to Earth.

                    and kill Thor. The warriors find Thor, but the Destroyer attacks and defeats them, prompting Thor to
                    offer himself instead. Struck by the Destroyer and near death, Thor's sacrifice proves him worthy to
                    wield Mjolnir. The hammer returns to him, restoring his powers and enabling him to defeat the Destroyer.
                    Kissing Jane goodbye and vowing to return, he and his fellow Asgardians leave to confront Loki.

                    father. Thor arrives and fights Loki before destroying the Bifröst Bridge to stop Loki's plan, stranding
                    himself in Asgard. Odin awakens and prevents the brothers from falling into the abyss created in the
                    wake of the bridge's destruction, but Loki allows himself to fall when Odin rejects his pleas for approval.

                    <br> In March 1942, Nazi officer Johann Schmidt and his men enter the town of Tønsberg in German-occupied
                    Norway, to steal a mysterious relic called the Tesseract, which possesses untold powers. Meanwhile, in
                    New York City, Steve Rogers is rejected for World War II military recruitment because of various health
                    and physical problems. While attending an exhibition of future technologies with his friend Sgt. James
                    "Bucky" Barnes, Rogers again attempts to enlist. Overhearing Rogers' conversation with Barnes about wanting
                    to help in the war, Dr. Abraham Erskine allows Rogers to enlist. He is recruited into the Strategic Scientific
                    Reserve as part of a "super-soldier" experiment under Erskine, Col. Chester Phillips, and British agent
                    Peggy Carter.

                    <br> Phillips is unconvinced by Erskine's claims that Rogers is the right person for the procedure but relents
                    after seeing Rogers commit an act of self-sacrificing bravery. The night before the treatment, Erskine
                    reveals to Rogers that Schmidt underwent an imperfect version of the procedure and suffered permanent
                    side-effects. Back in Europe, Schmidt and Dr. Arnim Zola harness the energies of the Tesseract, intending
                    to use the power to fuel Zola's inventions, mounting an offensive that will change the world. Schmidt
                    discovers Erskine's location and dispatches an assassin to kill him. In the U.S., Erskine subjects Rogers
                    to the super-soldier treatment, injecting him with a special serum and dosing him with "vita-rays". After
                    Rogers emerges from the experiment taller and more muscular, one of the attendees kills Erskine, revealing
                    himself to be Schmidt's assassin, Heinz Kruger.

                    <br> Rogers pursues and captures Kruger, but the assassin avoids interrogation by committing suicide by cyanide
                    capsule. With Erskine dead and his super-soldier formula lost, U.S. Senator Brandt has Rogers tour the
                    nation in a colorful costume as "Captain America" to promote war bonds, rather than allow scientists
                    to study him and attempt to rediscover the formula. In 1943, while on tour in Italy performing for active
                    servicemen, Rogers learns that Barnes's unit was MIA in a battle against Schmidt's forces. Refusing to
                    believe that Barnes is dead, Rogers has Carter and engineer Howard Stark fly him behind enemy lines to
                    mount a solo rescue attempt. Rogers infiltrates the fortress of Schmidt's Hydra organization, freeing
                    Barnes and the other prisoners. Rogers confronts Schmidt, who removes his mask, revealing a red, skull-like
                    visage that earned him the sobriquet "the Red Skull".

                    <br>Schmidt escapes and Rogers returns to base with the freed soldiers. Rogers recruits Barnes, Dum Dum Dugan,
                    Gabe Jones, Jim Morita, James Montgomery Falsworth, and Jacques Dernier to attack other known Hydra bases.
                    Stark outfits Rogers with advanced equipment, most notably a circular shield made of vibranium, a rare,
                    nearly indestructible metal. Rogers and his team sabotage various Hydra operations. The team later assaults
                    a train carrying Zola. Rogers and Jones succeed in capturing Zola, but Barnes falls from the train to
                    his assumed death. Using information extracted from Zola, the final Hydra stronghold is located, and
                    Rogers leads an attack to stop Schmidt from using weapons of mass destruction on American cities and
                    soon other major cities across the globe. Rogers climbs aboard Schmidt's aircraft as it takes off. During
                    the subsequent fight, the Tesseract's container is damaged. Schmidt physically handles the Tesseract,
                    causing him to dissolve in a bright light. The Tesseract falls to the floor, burning through the plane
                    and falling to Earth.

                    aircraft, presuming him dead. Rogers awakens in a 1940s-style hospital room. Deducing from an anachronistic
                    radio broadcast that something is wrong, he flees outside and finds himself in present-day Times Square,
                    where S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury informs him he has been "asleep" for nearly 70 years. In a post-credits

                    who responds by destroying Stark's home with helicopter gunships. Hansen, who came to warn Stark, survives
                    the attack along with Potts.

                    <br> Stark escapes in an Iron Man suit, which his artificial intelligence J.A.R.V.I.S. pilots to rural Tennessee,
                    following a flight plan from Stark's investigation into the Mandarin. Stark's experimental armor lacks
                    sufficient power to return to California, and the world believes him dead. Teaming with Harley, a precocious
                    10-year-old boy, Stark investigates the remains of a local explosion bearing the hallmarks of a Mandarin
                    attack. He discovers the "bombings" were triggered by soldiers subjected to Extremis, which at this stage
                    of development caused certain subjects to explosively reject the treatment.

                    <br> After veterans started exploding, these explosions were falsely attributed to a terrorist plot in order
                    to cover up Extremis's flaws. Stark witnesses Extremis firsthand when Mandarin agents Brandt and Savin
                    attack him. With Harley's help, Stark traces the Mandarin to Miami and infiltrates his headquarters using
                    improvised weapons. Inside he discovers the Mandarin is actually an English actor named Trevor Slattery,
                    who says he is oblivious to the actions carried out in his image.

                    program to include injured war veterans, reveals he is the real Mandarin, using Slattery as a cover.
                    After capturing Stark, Killian shows him Potts (whom he had kidnapped) being subjected to Extremis, in
                    order to gain Stark's aid to fix Extremis's flaws and thus save Potts. Killian kills Hansen when she
                    has a change of heart and tries to stop him. Killian has manipulated American intelligence agencies regarding
                    the Mandarin's location, luring James Rhodes – the former War Machine, now re-branded as the Iron Patriot
                    – into a trap to steal the armor. Stark escapes and reunites with Rhodes, discovering that Killian intends
                    to attack President Ellis aboard Air Force One.

                    on live television. The vice president will become a puppet leader, following Killian's orders in exchange
                    for Extremis to cure his young daughter's disability. On the platform, Stark goes to save Potts, as Rhodes
                    saves the president. Stark summons his Iron Man suits, controlled remotely by J.A.R.V.I.S., to provide
                    air support. Rhodes secures the president and takes him to safety, while Stark discovers Potts has survived
                    the Extremis procedure. However, before he can save her, a rig collapses around them and she falls to
                    her apparent death. Stark confronts Killian and traps him in an Iron Man suit that self-destructs, but
                    fails to kill him.

                    Potts, while the vice president and Slattery are arrested. With Stark's help, Potts' Extremis effects
                    are stabilized, and Stark undergoes surgery to remove the shrapnel embedded near his heart. He pitches

                    called the Kursed, on their home world of Svartalfheim, Bor safeguards the Aether within a stone column.

                    that the Convergence, a rare alignment of the Nine Realms, is imminent; as the event approaches, portals

                    releases an unearthly force, and Thor returns with her to Asgard. Odin, recognizing the Aether, warns
                    that the Aether will not only kill Jane, but that its return heralds a catastrophic prophecy. Malekith,

                    <fl>I</fl>n 1988, following his mother's death, a young Peter Quill is abducted from Earth by the Ravagers,
                    a group of space pirates led by Yondu Udonta.

                    <br> Twenty-six years later on the planet Morag, Quill steals an orb, after which Korath, a subordinate to
                    the fanatical Kree, Ronan, intercepts him. Although Quill escapes with the orb, Yondu discovers his theft
                    and issues a bounty for his capture, while Ronan sends the assassin Gamora after the orb. When Quill
                    attempts to sell the orb on the Nova Empire capital world, Xandar, Gamora ambushes him and steals it.
                    A fight ensues, drawing in a pair of bounty hunters: the genetically and cybernetically modified raccoon
                    Rocket, and the tree-like humanoid Groot.

                    <br> The Nova Corps arrives and arrests all four, imprisoning them in the Kyln. While there, a powerful inmate,
                    Drax, attempts to kill Gamora due to her association with Ronan, who killed his family. Quill convinces
                    Drax that Gamora can bring Ronan to him. Gamora reveals that she has betrayed Ronan, unwilling to let
                    him use the orb's power to destroy planets, starting with Xandar. Learning that Gamora has a buyer for
                    the orb, she, Quill, Rocket, Groot, and Drax work together to escape from the Kyln.

                    <br> Elsewhere, Ronan meets with Gamora's adoptive father, Thanos, to discuss her betrayal. Accompanied by
                    Drax, Quill's group escapes the Kyln in his ship – the Milano – and flees to Knowhere, a remote criminal
                    outpost in space built in the giant severed head of a Celestial. A drunken Drax summons Ronan while the
                    rest of the group meet Gamora's contact, the collector Taneleer Tivan. Tivan opens the orb, revealing
                    an Infinity Stone, an item of immeasurable power that destroys all but the most powerful beings who wield
                    it. Suddenly, Tivan's tormented assistant grabs the Stone, triggering an explosion that engulfs Tivan's
                    archive.

                    <br> Ronan arrives and easily defeats Drax, while the others flee by ship, pursued by Ronan's followers and
                    Gamora's sister Nebula. Nebula destroys Gamora's ship, leaving her floating in space, and Ronan's forces
                    capture the orb. Quill contacts Yondu before following Gamora into space, giving her his helmet to survive;
                    Yondu arrives and retrieves the pair. Rocket, Drax, and Groot threaten to attack Yondu's ship to rescue
                    them, but Quill negotiates a truce by convincing Yondu that they can recover the orb. Quill's group agrees
                    that facing Ronan means certain death, but that they cannot let him use the Infinity Stone to destroy
                    the galaxy.

                    <br> On Ronan's flagship, the Dark Aster, Ronan embeds the Stone in his warhammer, taking its power for himself.
                    He contacts Thanos, threatening to kill him after the destruction of Xandar; hateful of her adoptive
                    father, Nebula allies with Ronan. Near Xandar, the Ravagers, the Nova Corps, and Quill’s group confront
                    and breach the Dark Aster. Ronan uses his empowered warhammer to destroy the Nova Corps fleet. On the
                    Dark Aster, after Gamora defeats Nebula (who escapes), she unlocks Ronan's chambers, but the group find
                    themselves outmatched by his power until Rocket crashes the Milano through the Dark Aster. The damaged
                    Dark Aster crash-lands on Xandar, with Groot sacrificing himself to shield the group.

                    <br> Ronan emerges from the wreck and prepares to destroy Xandar, but Quill distracts him, allowing Drax
                    and Rocket to destroy Ronan's warhammer. Quill grabs the freed Stone, and with Gamora, Drax, and Rocket
                    sharing its burden, they use it to destroy Ronan. In the aftermath, Quill tricks Yondu into taking a
                    container supposedly containing the Stone, and gives the real Stone to the Nova Corps. As the Ravagers
                    leave Xandar, Yondu remarks that it turned out well that they did not deliver Quill to his father per
                    their contract. Quill's group, now known as the Guardians of the Galaxy, have their criminal records
                    expunged, and Quill learns that he is only half-human, his father being part of an ancient, unknown species.
                    Quill finally opens the last present he received from his mother: a cassette tape filled with her favorite
                    songs. The Guardians leave in the rebuilt Milano along with a sapling cut from Groot. In a post-credits
                    scene, Tivan sits in his destroyed archive with two of his living exhibits: a canine cosmonaut and an
                    anthropomorphic duck.

                <strong>Avengers: Age of Ultron</strong>
                <p id="avengers2">In the Eastern European country of Sokovia, the Avengers – Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Thor, Bruce Banner (Hulk),
                    Natasha Romanoff, and Clint Barton – raid a Hydra outpost led by Baron Wolfgang von Strucker, who has
                    been experimenting on humans using the scepter previously wielded by Loki.

                    <br> They encounter two of Strucker's experiments – twins Pietro, who has superhuman speed, and Wanda Maximoff,
                    who can manipulate minds and project energy – and apprehend Strucker, while Stark retrieves Loki's scepter.
                    Stark and Banner discover an artificial intelligence within the scepter's gem, and secretly use it to
                    complete Stark's "Ultron" global defense program. The unexpectedly sentient Ultron, believing he must
                    eradicate humanity to save Earth, eliminates Stark's A.I. J.A.R.V.I.S. and attacks the Avengers at their
                    headquarters.

                    <br> Escaping with the scepter, Ultron uses the resources in Strucker's Sokovia base to upgrade his rudimentary
                    body and build an army of robot drones. Having killed Strucker, he recruits the Maximoffs, who hold Stark
                    responsible for their parents' deaths by his weapons, and go to the base of arms dealer Ulysses Klaue
                    to obtain Wakandan vibranium. The Avengers attack Ultron and the Maximoffs, but Wanda subdues them with
                    haunting visions, causing the Hulk to rampage until Stark stops him with his anti-Hulk armor.2 A worldwide
                    backlash over the resulting destruction, and the fears Wanda's hallucinations incited, send the team
                    into hiding at a safehouse.

                    hallucination, while Romanoff and Banner plan to flee together after realizing a mutual attraction. However,
                    Nick Fury arrives and encourages the team to form a plan to stop Ultron. In Seoul, Ultron forces the
                    team's friend Dr. Helen Cho to use her synthetic-tissue technology, together with vibranium and the scepter's
                    gem, to perfect a new body for him. As Ultron uploads himself into the body, Wanda is able to read his
                    mind; discovering his plan for human extinction, the Maximoffs turn on Ultron.

                    The Avengers fight amongst themselves when Stark secretly uploads J.A.R.V.I.S. – who is still operational
                    after hiding from Ultron inside the Internet – into the synthetic body. Thor returns to help activate
                    the body, explaining that the gem on its brow – one of the six Infinity Stones, the most powerful objects
                    in existence – was part of his vision. This "Vision" and the Maximoffs accompany the Avengers to Sokovia,
                    where Ultron has used the remaining vibranium to build a machine to lift a large part of the capital
                    city skyward, intending to crash it into the ground to cause global extinction. Banner rescues Romanoff,
                    who awakens the Hulk for the battle. The Avengers fight Ultron's army while Fury arrives in a Helicarrier
                    with Maria Hill, James Rhodes and S.H.I.E.L.D. agents to evacuate civilians. Pietro dies when he shields
                    Barton from gunfire, and a vengeful Wanda abandons her post to destroy Ultron's primary body, which allows
                    one of his drones to activate the machine.

                    the Hulk, unwilling to endanger Romanoff by being with her, departs in a Quinjet, while the Vision confronts
                    Ultron's last remaining body. Later, with the Avengers having established a new base run by Fury, Hill,
                    Cho, and Selvig, Thor returns to Asgard to learn more about the forces he suspects have manipulated recent
                    events. As Stark and Barton also leave, Rogers and Romanoff prepare to train new Avengers: Rhodes, the
                    Vision, Sam Wilson, and Wanda. In a mid-credits scene, Thanos, dissatisfied by the failures of his pawns,
                    dons a gauntlet3 and vows to personally retrieve the Infinity Stones.

                    shrinking technology. Believing the technology is dangerous, Pym vows to hide it as long as he lives.
                    In the present day, Pym's estranged daughter, Hope van Dyne, and former protégé, Darren Cross, have forced
                    him out of his company, Pym Technologies. Cross is close to perfecting a shrinking suit of his own, the
                    Yellowjacket, which horrifies Pym.

                    fiancé, Paxton, for not providing child support. Unable to hold a job because of his criminal record,
                    Lang agrees to join Luis' crew and commit a burglary. Lang breaks into a house and cracks its safe, but
                    only finds what he believes to be an old motorcycle suit, which he takes home.

                    Lang in jail and smuggles the suit into his cell to help him break out. Pym, who manipulated Lang through
                    an unknowing Luis into stealing the suit as a test, wants Lang to become the new Ant-Man to steal the

                    reveals that Janet, known as the Wasp, disappeared into a subatomic quantum realm while disabling a Soviet
                    nuclear missile. Pym warns Lang that he could suffer a similar fate if he overrides his suit's regulator.
                    They send him to steal a device that will aid their heist from the Avengers' headquarters, where he briefly

                    realm but manages to reverse the effects and returns to the macroscopic world. In gratitude for Lang's
                    heroism, Paxton covers for Lang to keep him out of prison. Seeing that Lang survived and returned from
                    the quantum realm, Pym wonders if his wife is alive as well. Later, Lang meets up with Luis, who tells
                    him that Wilson is looking for him. In a mid-credits scene, Pym shows van Dyne a new Wasp prototype suit
                    and offers it to her. In a post-credits scene, Wilson and Steve Rogers have Bucky Barnes in their custody.
                    Unable to contact Tony Stark because of "the accords", Wilson mentions that he knows someone who could
